      <h3>1st Gen (1967–1969)</h3>

      <span class="tag">Birth & Rivalry</span>

      <p>The Chevrolet Camaro was created in 1967 to directly compete with the Ford Mustang. It was offered with a range of engines from six-cylinder to big-block V8s. The RS, SS, and Z/28 trims quickly became popular, giving the Camaro its signature long-hood, short-deck design and establishing it as a serious competitor in the muscle car world.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="event">

      <h3>2nd Gen (1970–1981)</h3>

      <span class="tag">Bigger & Sleeker</span>

      <p>The second-generation Camaro featured lower, wider styling with European influences. V8 performance remained strong, and trims like Z/28 and SS continued to excite enthusiasts. While emissions regulations gradually reduced engine power, the Camaro maintained its aggressive muscle car image and became a staple of 1970s performance culture.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="event">

      <h3>3rd Gen (1982–1992)</h3>

      <span class="tag">80s Tech</span>

      <p>The third generation Camaro had a lighter chassis and improved aerodynamics. Electronic fuel injection became standard, and the IROC-Z trim emphasized handling. These changes helped the Camaro stay competitive on both streets and tracks during the 1980s, appealing to a younger, performance-focused audience.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="event">

      <h3>4th Gen (1993–2002)</h3>

      <span class="tag">Smooth & Modern</span>

      <p>The fourth generation Camaro introduced curvier styling and updated LT1 and LS-series V8 engines. Interiors and technology were improved, and performance remained strong. Despite these upgrades, declining coupe sales eventually led to the end of production in 2002.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="event">

      <h3>5th Gen (2010–2015)</h3>

      <span class="tag">Retro Revival</span>

      <p>After an eight-year hiatus, the Camaro returned in 2010 with retro-inspired styling and a modern chassis. Powerful engines and media appearances, such as the Transformers movies, brought the Camaro back into global attention. This generation successfully combined nostalgia with contemporary performance and technology.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="event">

      <h3>6th Gen (2016–present)</h3>

      <span class="tag">Modern Muscle</span>

      <p>The current Camaro is lighter, sharper, and equipped with advanced technology. The ZL1 supercharged V8 offers track-capable performance, while the styling pays homage to its heritage. It combines muscle car tradition with modern safety and infotainment features.</p>

      <h3>1st Gen (1964½–1973)</h3>

      <span class="tag">Invents Pony Car</span>

      <p>The Ford Mustang launched the pony car category in 1964. It offered engines from an inline-six to powerful V8s, quickly gaining popularity. High-performance trims like the Shelby GT350 and GT500 set a benchmark for future Mustangs and helped establish a lasting performance legacy.</p>

    <div class="event">

      <h3>2nd Gen (1974–1978)</h3>

      <span class="tag">Fuel-Economy Era</span>

      <p>The Mustang II was a smaller, lighter version designed to meet the fuel crisis demands. While it had less power than its predecessor, it preserved the Mustang brand during challenging market conditions and maintained a loyal fanbase.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="event">

      <h3>3rd Gen (1979–1993)</h3>

      <span class="tag">Fox Platform</span>

      <p>The third-generation Mustang used the Fox platform, which made it lighter and more tunable. V8 power returned, making it popular with modifiers and racers. This generation strengthened the Mustang’s position in the performance car scene.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="event">

      <h3>4th Gen (1994–2004)</h3>

      <span class="tag">Refined Performance</span>

    </div>

    <div class="event">

      <h3>6th Gen (2015–2023)</h3>

      <span class="tag">Global Tech</span>

      <p>The sixth generation Mustang featured an independent rear suspension and a global platform. It offered modern performance editions, updated interiors, and technology upgrades, blending classic Mustang characteristics with modern requirements.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="event">

      <h3>7th Gen (2024–present)</h3>

      <span class="tag">Newest Chapter</span>
